# WODWELLWorkoutAnalysis
==============================

For lots of people, getting excited to go into the gym is hard. With every other drain life has on your time and energy, carving out an hour to workout can be really challenging. As a gym owner or workout programmer, how do you keep your members excited to come in and engaged and interested in the workouts you write? There are tons of resources for writing workouts and planning programming but oftentimes you donâ€™t know how a workout will be received until after it's been the workout of the day at your gym. Our goal is to identify what aspects of a workout make it popular and what causes people to skip that day, or in other words, cherry pick that workout. Our focus will be on CrossFit, more specifically on workouts logged on WODWELL.com.
